		<p id="paragraph1">My name is Austen Pritchett. I am 24 years old and live in Utah County. I attended Utah State University and completed 2 years there but never declared a major. I left because I wasn't sure what I wanted to go into and it was a waste of money to just keep going with no direction. I recently decided to try my hand at coding because I've always thought it would be cool, but never knew where to start. It is also in demand and will provide me a fulfilling new career.</p>

		<p id="paragraph2">I have been working at Walmart for 5 years now. I started as a seasonal hire and was brought on full time. After working there for just 3 months, I was offered the supervisor role of the crew I was on, but turned it down. I was offered many other promotions but didn't start taking them till a few years ago. I am currently managing the backroom and the freight that we recieve. I am very detail oriented and I like to do things correct the first time.</p>
